  # Build command - uses npm workspaces from repo root
  command = "npm install && npm run build:simphantoe"
  # Output directory (absolute path from repo root)

# Production context
[context.production]

# Preview/branch deploys
[context.deploy-preview]
  environment = { NODE_VERSION = "22" }

# Headers configuration
# Note: COOP/COEP headers for SharedArrayBuffer are NOT set here because:
# 1. FHE SDK uses thread: 0 (single-threaded mode, no SharedArrayBuffer needed)
# 2. Privy embedded wallets require iframes that break with strict COOP/COEP
# If you need multi-threaded FHE in the future, you'll need to choose between
# Privy embedded wallets and FHE threading.

# WASM files need correct MIME type
[[headers]]
  for = "/*.wasm"
  [headers.values]
    Content-Type = "application/wasm"

# SPA fallback - redirect all routes to index.html
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
